Target Date Definition:
Target-date funds are structured to maximize the investor's returns by a specific date. Generally, the funds are designed to build gains in the early years by focusing on riskier growth stocks, then they aim to retain those gains by weighting towards safer, more conservative choices as the target date approaches.

While target date funds (TDF) are structured as mutual funds designed to manage investment risk, they can be more complex. Individual investors usually pick a fund with a target year closest to the year you anticipate retiring, say a "2050 Fund." The closer a fund gets to its target date, the more it focuses on assets with a lower risk profile, such as fixed income, cash, and cash equivalents. This shift across lower-risk asset classes is called a "glide path." A fund's glide path is designed to reduce investment risk over timeâ€”but glide paths can vary considerably from fund to fund.<br>
Critical Considerations of Target Date Funds: <br>
As with other mutual funds, fees are vital as a slight difference in fees (measured in percentages) can add up to a significant dollar difference in the returns. <br>
It is also essential to look at one's overall investment portfolio. An outsized investment holding in either stocks or bonds can magnify or offset the impact of your target fund returns. <br>
More critically, the nature of these funds is more of a "set it and forget it" mechanism, with investors contributing their money regularly (usually on a paycheck basis) over time. Unfortunately, the allocations may not account for market events or economic concerns. Over time, from entering the corporate world to when they retire or experience several life event, they may not consider your risk tolerance. Monitoring any TDF's performance is crucial to ensure that it meets one's investment risk tolerance over time. <br>
Lastly, while it is possible to invest in a target date fund outside of a tax-advantaged retirement vehicle such as an IRA or 401(k), investors must be aware of the taxation repercussions of their investment. More specifically, these funds generate taxable income such as interest, dividends, and capital gains that lower overall returns. <br>
